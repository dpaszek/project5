Project description: 
- The game I am creating will be called "Trash Shark" in which the player (a shark sprite)
will work to clean up the ocean by eating trash, which will also be incorporated as a smart
sprite.  There will be a limited number of trash sprites, so the user will work their best to
dispel of all of the trash as quickly as they can (the shorter the time the better) while 
attempting to avoid the other fish in the sea as "fish are friends, not food."  I don't plan
to have the user shoot or anything so it will be a matter of using ASDW to move the shark to
the location of the trash and dispel of it on contact.  The game will end when either all of
trash is gotten rid of or if the shark does end up making contact with another fish.  
Therefore, successful completion of the game can only occur if all of the trash is picked up
without making contact with another fish, and from there, players can strive to pick up the 
trash in the least amount of time.
